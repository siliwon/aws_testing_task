# aws_testing_task

## Preparation to work

To install all needed dependencies run such commands as follows:
* `python -m venv venv` - creates a virtualenv for further installations and work
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` - install all dependencies needed to work with the project.

## The Factorial task
The task is placed in `factorial` folder. The code and the tests for it are stored separately. The pytest framework for the unit tests was used.

To run the "factorial" program run `python3 factorial/factorial.py` and put any number you want!

To run tests simply run `pytest` command from the root directory or use the embedded test runner in your IDE.
